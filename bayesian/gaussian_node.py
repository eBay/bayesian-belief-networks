    This is derived from the psuedo code

    http://www.stanford.edu/dept/MSandE/cgi-bin/people/faculty/shachter/pdfs/gaussid.pdf
    s is an ordering of the nodes in which no
    dependent variable occurs before its parents.
    To make this work we have to make sure we
    are using the same notation that they use.
    See beginning of chapter 2.
    For the example we have X1, X2 and X3
    Thus n = [1, 2, 3]
    s = [1, 2, 3] (This is the ordered sequence)
    for now C is a dict with the vals being
    the list of parents so
    C[1] = []
    C[2] = [1]
    C[3] = [2]
    betas is a dict of the betas keyed
    by a tuple representing the node
    indices.
    Ok I can verify that this one works!
    for the example in Koller and in the presentation page 19
    it gets correct results...
    Now to check for the river example.

    Woohoo, this works for the river example!!!!
    Now I will write an _3 version that
    uses more sensible arguments...
