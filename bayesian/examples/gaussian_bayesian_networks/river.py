This example comes from page 3 of
http://people.cs.aau.dk/~uk/papers/castillo-kjaerulff-03.pdf

Note that to create a Guassian Node
we supply mean and standard deviation,
this differs from the example in the
above paper which uses variance (=std. dev.) ** 2

Note in the paper they specify variance,
wheres as this example we are  using std. dev.
instead hence for A the variance is 4 and std_dev is 2.
