This is a simple example with 3 variables:

         +----+    +----+    +----+
         | X1 |--->| X2 |--->| X3 |
         +----+    +----+    +----+

With parameters:

p(X1) ~ N(1; 4)
p(X2|X1) ~ N(0.5X1 - 3.5; 4)
p(X3|X2) ~ N(-X2 + 1; 3)

Remember that in our gaussian decorators
we are using Standard Deviation while the
Koller example uses Variance.
